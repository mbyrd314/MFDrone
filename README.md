# MFDrone
Software for a proof-of-concept project to have a drone replace another drone's battery while they are both flying

The software includes multithreaded code written in Python to manage sensor inputs from computer vision, ultrasonic
distance sensors, and IR sensors. The computer vision code is also written in Python, specifically OpenCV. There is
also an Android app to determine the GPS location of the DJI drone that we used for testing.
